[B]Tier 1[/B]

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196406-backdraft]Backdraft[/url] causes your Conflagrate to grant you 2 stacks of a 10 second buff that reduces the cast time of your next Incinerate or Chaos Bolt by 30% this buff stacks up to 4 times.

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205184-roaring-blaze]Roaring Blaze[/url] causes your Conflagrate cast on an enemy with Immolate to increase the remaining damage your immolate will do to that target by 25%. The bonus damage is lost if you refresh your Immolate on the target before the Immolate runs off by itself.

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/17877-shadowburn]Shadowburn[/url] replaces your Conflagrate. When you cast Shadowburn on a target you generate 1 shard and apply a 5 second debuff on that target. If the target dies while affected by this debuff you will gain 1 more shard. This debuff's duration is refreshed if you cast shadowburn on a target already affected. This means you wont be able to get more than 1 shard from a target dying.

[B]Final Thoughts[/B]
Theoretically in the majority of situations you'll wanna go Roaring Blaze here since with the tier 19 4-set you'll be able to get more conflagrates into your immolate duration, however Roaring Blaze requires such a change in playstyle that often times you wont be able to use it to it's full potential. Therefore Backdraft will be your default choice here.

[B]Tier 2[/B]

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205148-reverse-entropy]Reverse Entropy[/url] reduces the cast time of your Chaos Bolt by 0.5 seconds and causes your Chaos Bolt and Rain of Fire to refund 35% of your max mana when cast. 

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196412-eradication]Eradication[/url] makes your Chaos Bolt apply a 6 second debuff on the target(s) hit that increases the damage you deal to that target by 12%. This debuff is also applied to targets hit by your Chaos Bolts through Havoc.

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235157-empowered-life-tap]Empower Life Tap[/url] causes your Life Tap to grant you a buff that increases all damage you deal by 10% for 20 seconds.

[B]Final Thoughts[/B]
There are only really 2 viable choices here, you should either go Eradication or Empower Life Tap, there are both upsides and downsides to both talents:
Eradication has the highest damage potential and will often be the stronger choice especially if you're using [url=http://www.wowdb.com/items/132456-feretory-of-souls]Feretory of Souls[/url], tier 19 2-set and have around 28% haste. When playing Eradication you should try have as high uptime on the target as possible.
Empower Life Tap grants a damage increase only 2% lower than Eradication and the major upside to this is that you will easily be able to maintain 100% uptime on this buff on a normal encounter. The downside to using this is that you will be casting Life Tap more than you would otherwise, that means more of your globals will be spent on it and you will be taking more self inflicted damage. 
TL;DR - Both Eradication and Empower Life Tap are strong, if you're geared and have the potential to keep a high uptime of Eradication on the target this should be your choice, if not then go Empower Life Tap.

[B]Tier 3[/B]

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48018-demonic-circle]Demonic Circle[/url] creates when cast a circle on your location for 15 minutes. When cast again you will be teleported to this location and then spell will go on cooldown. If you'll later want to change the location of your circle within the 15 minutes of it's duration, you will have to cancel the buff and then cast it again.

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108396-mortal-coil]Mortal Coil[/url] horrifies your target for 3 seconds and heals you for 20% of your max hp. Havoc also copies this spell. The spell only heals if the target is affected by the fear.

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/30283-shadowfury]Shadowfury[/url] is a 1.5 second cast 8 yard stun that stuns all enemies in it's target range for 4 seconds.

[B]Final Thoughts[/B]
For a raiding situation you'll 90% of the time end up going Demonic Circle. Mortal Coil requires something to be able to be feared in order to be useful and if you choose this for the cc Shadowfury is really the stronger option as it cc's for longer, it's cc can't be broken by damage and it's cooldown is lower.

[B]Tier 4[/B]

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152108-cataclysm]Cataclysm[/url] is a 3 second cast that hits all enemies within 8 yards of it's target location and applies immolate to those targets. 

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196408-fire-and-brimstone]Fire and Brimstone[/url] is a passive that makes your Incinerate hit all enemies near your target. 

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196098-soul-harvest]Soul Harvest[/url] is sort of like the old Dark Soul. It's a 20% damage increase for 15 seconds, it's duration is extended by 2 seconds for every enemy afflicted by immolate when cast. The duration can be extended up to 35 seconds.

[B]Final Thoughts[/B]
Soul Harvest is your best choice for 1-3 targets.
Cataclysm will be your choice if you have 4 targets that have to die within 15-25 seconds.
Fire and Brimstone is the best AoE talent if you have 4+ targets that are going to live for an extended period of time (35+ seconds)

[B]Tier 5[/B]

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/219272-demon-skin]Demon Skin[/url] makes your Soul Leech charge passively at a rate of 1% maximum health per second and also makes your Soul Leech absorb up to 20% of your max health instead of 15%

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/111400-burning-rush]Burning Rush[/url] increases your movement speed by 50% while damaging you for 4% of your max hp per second. Note that while this effect is active movement impairing effects may not reduce your movement speed to below 100% of normal movement speed. This effect cannot kill you.

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108416-dark-pact]Dark pact[/url] sacrifices 20% of your demon's health and grants you a shield of 400% of the sacrificed health. If you dont have a demon your health will be sacrificed instead. This can be cast while stunned. 

[B]Final Thoughts[/B]
This tier is very situational, all choices have great utility however you'll want to be careful when using Burning Rush. That being said you'll go Burning Rush most of the time as warlocks do not have any movement speed increases and in some situations you will be able to dodge deadly mechanics while using this.

[B]Tier 6[/B]

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152107-grimoire-of-supremacy]Grimoire of Supremacy[/url] makes you able to summon either a Doomguard or an Infernal as your permanent pet.

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108501-grimoire-of-service]Grimoire of Service[/url] makes you able to summon a second demon for 25 seconds on a 1.5 min cooldown. The summoned demon deals 100% increased damage. Depending on what pet you summon that pet will use one of it's special abilities when summoned. 

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108503-grimoire-of-sacrifice]Grimoire of Sacrifice[/url] sacrifices your pet and grants you a 1 hour buff that makes your spells sometimes deal additional damage from the target hit and in an 8 yrd range from that target. This buff is removed if you summon a new pet.

[B]Final Thoughts[/B]
9/10 times you'll go Grimoire of Service. The only situation you'll really want to go Grimoire of Sacrifice is in high AoE cleave situations where more than 4+ targets are present for an extended duration. Ideally you'll only go Grimoire of Sacrifice in low mythic+.

[B]Tier 7[/B]

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196410-wreak-havoc]Wreak Havoc[/url] makes your havoc last 20 seconds and removes it's cooldown.

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196447-channel-demonfire]Channel Demonfire[/url] launches 15 felfire bolts over a 3 second cast to a random enemy afflicted by immolate in a 40 yrd range of you. The bolts do splash damage to enemies near the target.

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/215941-soul-conduit]Soul Conduit[/url] is a passive that gives every soul shard you spend a 20% chance to be refunded. 

[B]Final Thoughts[/B]
Your talent choice here is very situational. Wreak havoc should be your default choice on any cleave/multiple target fight. This talent is extremely strong and beats the other 2 options by miles. Channel Demonfire is very strong singletarget if you're not using [url=http://www.wowdb.com/items/132456-feretory-of-souls]Feretory of Souls[/url]. This is also strong when lined up with Cataclysm for m+. Soul Conduit should be used if specced into Eradication  on singletarget, this can also be an option if going for a very heavy AoE build since Rain of Fire also benefits from its effect.
