    <p><strong>Tier 15:</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48181-haunt" target="_blank">Haunt</a>:</u></strong> This talent has gone under some more changes since 7.0.3 and 7.1.0. It’s in considerately better shape since the updates, but seems very lack-luster compared to Malefic Grasp. One thing to note is it increases all damage dealt, not just dots, meaning it may have some potential when combined with specific on-use trinkets.</li>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196102-writhe-in-agony" target="_blank">Writhe in Agony</a>:</u></strong> Defacto talent for any fight where you will be consitantly having 3+ targets with agony. It is net 0 difference between MG on 2 target, but there is typically one target that needs to die faster, so pick MG instead of this for 2 target.</li>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/235155-malefic-grasp" target="_blank">Malefic Grasp</a>:</u></strong> While you channel Drain Soul on the target, your dots deal <span class="xbbcode-s">80</span>70% bonus damage. This is the go-to single target talent and 2 targets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Much like with 7.1.0, it’s going to be a choice between the Agony and Malefic Grasp talent. Haunt has some possible niche uses in a hectic add fight similar to Ilgynoth, but it’s not likely to see much use. Agony is going to be nice in high end M+ when you are not needing specific target damage, or when the affixes discourage bursting a specific target, as well as for cheesing fights like Botanist. Almost all other situations, Malefic Grasp will be the go to talent, allowing for us to really keep up and pull ahead in single target situations, even with the hotfix nurf.</p>
<div class="center">

    <p><strong>Tier 30:</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196105-contagion" target="_blank">Contagion</a>:</u></strong> Increases damage delt to targets effected by contagion by 18%. Small buff in 7.1.5 keeps it actually useful compared to AC and Mana Tap.</li>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196103-absolute-corruption" target="_blank">Absolute Corruption</a>:</u></strong> Makes Corruption permanent (or 40 seconds in PVP) and makes it do 25% more damage. Lots of situations where this lets you drop a DOT from your rotation, really smoothing out rotations involving Malefic Grasp / effigy.</li>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/235157-empowered-life-tap" target="_blank">Empowered Life Tap</a>:</u></strong> This is a maintennce buff tied to life tap, increasing all damage delt by 10%. This is a strong talent for AOE and for when you aren’t necessarily going to be choosing malefic grasp.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The choice on these is highly dependant on your other talents. If you are chosing Malefic Grasp and Effigy, AC pulls very far ahead due to GCD saving for more and smother drain rotations. Contagion is best for Soul Conduit builds, which will not effective without specific legendaries and t194p, and should still be below effigy builds. Empowered Life Tap is a very strong item for M+ when using Sow the Seeds.</p>

    <p><strong>Tier 45:</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48018-demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a>:</u></strong> Spell is almost the same, except now you need to create a cancel aura macro to make it work properly. See Macros section for more info on this.</li>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108396-mortal-coil" target="_blank">Mortal Coil</a>:</u></strong> Works exactly as it does on live, including not healing or doing damage to bosses.</li>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/5484-howl-of-terror" target="_blank">Howl of Terror</a>:</u></strong> AOE fear instead of getting shadowfury. Very sad. But hey, at least it’s an instant cast... Unlike shadowfury...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Portal is now baseline as it’s ever been since June 2016. Mortal Coil has some uses in Mythic+ as it does not share the same DR as stuns. Howl of Terror is almost only useable to proc Sephuz if you have the legendary (it is off of the GCD).</p>

    <p><strong>Tier 60:</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        <u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/63106-siphon-life" target="_blank">Siphon Life</a>:</strong></u> Provides an extra DOT that deals as much as an unbuffed Corruption, similar duration, and heals you for all the damage it deals in addition it counts for extra damage on <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/54049-shadow-bite" target="_blank">Shadow Bite</a>. This will have some places to shine when you need the bonus healing, and is the go-to for 1 and 2 target dps. Often used in conjunction with Absolute Corruption. <strong>NOTE: This spell IS affected by mastery.</strong>
    </li>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196226-sow-the-seeds" target="_blank">Sow the Seeds</a>:</u></strong> Causes your Seed of Corruption to fire off up to an additional 2 targets. This takes seeds from doing some damage and primarily used to spread corruption quickly, to doing a LOT of aoe damage, and is really awesome to watch (Although not quite as awesome looking now that there is only 3 :( ).</li>
    <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196098-soul-harvest" target="_blank">Soul Harvest</a>:</strong></u> Provides a 20% damage boost for 15 seconds +2 seconds per agony you have active. This has a lot of uses for when you need the damage boost for ~20 seconds. You should typically have this at 19 seconds at a minimum.</li>
</ul><strong>Verdict:</strong> There’s quite a few options here. Siphon Life is a go to for pure single target, while Sow the Seeds is very strong for aoe. Soul Harvest is an interesting talent now, in pure single target it should be a 19 second bonus, higher if you can run more targets, this gives you the option to have a very strong burst window, being capable of bursting early in the fight for 2 UA-MG cycles if you time it correctly.
<div class="center">
    <img class="heading" src="http://imgur.com/VfaNNvHl.png">
    <p><strong>Tier 75:</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/219272-demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a>:</u></strong> Causes your Soul Leech to passively regen over time, and provides an absorb shield up for up to 20% of your max HP. <strong>7.1</strong><i>Not really a 7.1 note, but REMEMBER soul leech is a 15% shield that generates from your damage. This move is NOT as bad as presumed.</i></li>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/111400-burning-rush" target="_blank">Burning Rush</a>:</u></strong> Copy Pasta ability from live, handy on fights that give a slow debuff (cenarius).</li>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108416-dark-pact" target="_blank">Dark Pact</a>:</u></strong> Works like Sacrificial Pact on live. Awesome damage reduction Cooldown.</li>
</ul><strong>Verdict:</strong> This is a fight by fight, depending on the damage reduction, or Burning Rush. Any fight that has a reliable burst of damage every minute (IE: Ursoc charge) take <span class="xbbcode-s">Sac</span>Dark Pact. If the fight has any major mechanics that wreck your mobility (Cenarius dryads) or for mythic+ dungeons to make sure you go very fast, take Burning Rush. Demon Skin is an excellent spell for moderate sustain damage (Cenarius is again an excellent example)
<div class="center">
    <img class="heading" src="http://i.imgur.com/F9swA5Ll.png">
    <p><strong>Tier 90:</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152107-grimoire-of-supremacy" target="_blank">Grimoire of Supremacy</a>:</strong></u> Gives you the ability to summon your Doomguard / Infernal as permanent pets instead of 3 min cooldowns. Doomguard has an interrupt and massive slow, and Infernal has an offensive dispel and an AoE stun. Infernal has been buffed significantly from the WoD version and is now a decent option for aoe damage. The biggest benefit with this talent is your ability to swap from single target to aoe inbetween pulls as needed in an instance, which is very powerful in mythic + dungeons where you cannot swap talents.</li>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108501-grimoire-of-service" target="_blank">Grimoire of Service</a>:</u></strong> Gives you a cooldown every minute and a half, giving you (Generally) a bonus Felhunter that deals twice damage that the standard one deals. This does cost a shard so it’s kind of annoying to use on single target. <strong>NOTE: GoServ Felhunter will interrupt when it spawns, giving you a bonus interrupt in Mythic+</strong></li>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108503-grimoire-of-sacrifice" target="_blank">Grimoire of Sacrifice</a>:</u></strong> This has been dramatically changed from the WoD version. Legion Sacrifice causes ALL spells to periodically pulse for aoe damage, and it does quite a bit of damage. This is a great option to gain passive cleave damage for sacrificing a single target cooldown. The only downside is that you will be losing your pet Command Demon ability, specifically losing your only interrupt.</li>
</ul><strong>Verdict:</strong> This revolves into 2 things. Pure single target, service is higher than all other specs for single target, so this is the go to for your Ursoc fights. Supremacy gives you a Stun and solid AOE in M+, and lets you hot swap to a single target pet just before a boss. MG Favors Supremacy due to the usability issues with shard costs involved in running service.

    <img class="heading" src="http://i.imgur.com/UfwYgHAl.png">
    <p><strong>Tier 100:</strong></p>
</div>
<ul>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205178-soul-effigy" target="_blank">Soul Effigy</a>:</u></strong> Definitely the best to use if you need single target damage, or it’s a single/ 2 target fight. Targeting this thing is still a pain, so it’s recommended to sacrifice your focus target and use that.</li>
    <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205179-phantom-singularity" target="_blank">Phantom Singularity</a>:</u></strong> Probably most useful for mythics and / or aoe fights where you're lacking in Brostorm and Kappabeams. Deals a butt ton of damage on aoe, so it is pretty nice when you’re trying to get that going.</li>
    <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/215941-soul-conduit" target="_blank">Soul Conduit</a>:</strong></u> Provides 20% chance of soulshard spent to be refunded. Pretty interesting talent, and definitely pulls ahead on 2 target. This talent is a viable option to those who hate to deal with effigy, but it will not pull ahead of effigy in any situation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Due to shard generation changes, this (again) will depend on your fight. Phantom Singularity does a monstrous amount of damage now, and has a 25 yard radius so it hits just about everything in range of the boss. if you don’t need the aoe, look between Soul Conduit and Effigy. Conduit is kind of turning into the de-facto Mythic + talent, especially with the t19 4p and more legendaries opening up to players. Any time where sustained single target is more important, even on multi target fights, you will still want to run Effigy because of the damage boost. For single target you 100% want to run effigy, but thats only 1-2 fights currently in Nighthold. Effigy also is less appealing when you run into many adds due to the extra dot maintenance cutting into drain cycles (more on this later)</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size:30px">Recommended Talent Builds</span></strong></p>
<p>With the 7.1.5 changes, there are many new ranges of talent builds out for the affliction warlock. General Mythic+ / dungeon builds, and raids.</p>

<div class="center"><h3><u>Heroics, Mythic+9 and lower:</u></h3></div>
<x-talent talent="3302012" spec="Affliction"></x-talent>
<br>
<p>This is a build that focuses on Burst AOE, and allowing you some measure of burst on single target. Spam AOE and try to snipe targets for drain as you can during trash, and you still have MG available for boss damage. With Soul Conduit, your boss damage shouldn’t be terrible as long as you can get one or two lucky procs.</p>
<div class="center"><h3><u>Mythic +10 and higher:</u></h3></div>
<x-talent talent="2201013" spec="Affliction"></x-talent>
<br>
<p>This build is for when things start to not be bursted in 10 seconds, Ideally on affixes that involve things dying close to the same time, and taking 30+ seconds to kill. Priority with this will typically be Refresh Agony (5 seconds or less on dot) &gt; Dump shards (if 4 or 5, drop to 2 shards if possible) &gt; Refresh Siphon Life. SL does ok damage, but has a much lower DPC than UA does, so don’t cap shards.</p>
<div class="center"><h3><u>General Purpose Raid Build:</u></h3></div>
<x-talent talent="3101011" spec="Affliction"></x-talent>
<br>
<p>This is your pure single target setup. This is your general purpose raid build for maximum boss damage, which is what we are going to specialize in.</p>
<div class="center"><h3><u>Hypster Multi Target Padding:</u></h3></div>
<x-talent talent="2201011" spec="Affliction"></x-talent>
<br>
<p>This is the old single target build from 7.1.0, and its still going to have some uses for padding on various fights, and dealing solid sustained multi target damage. This is going to only be useful when you can maintain 3+ targets with agony at 20 stacks for at least 3/4ths of the fight, so Cenarius, Xavius, Dragons, and looking into EN Botanist comes to mind (padding only).</p>
