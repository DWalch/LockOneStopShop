    <p> This is an informational about talents.  First half is an in-depth walkthrough of the affliction talents, and the 2nd half is some information about talent builds and how good they are.  A thing to remember, is that the affliciton talents are incredibly balanced now, with a 2% difference in the level 100 tree, and about a 3% difference in the 15 tree (the two trees with the most options)</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 15:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48181-haunt" target="_blank">Haunt</a>:</u></strong> While this talent has been "Nurfed" with the 7.2.5 patch, the relative strength of this talent compared to the other two has been considerably buffed.  This will definitely have uses in mid to low end Mythic Plus, as well as fights with consistant target swapping, such as botanist.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196102-writhe-in-agony" target="_blank">Writhe in Agony</a>:</u></strong> Defacto talent for any fight where you will be consitantly having 3+ targets with agony. It is net 0 difference between MG on 2 target, but there is typically one target that needs to die faster, so pick MG instead of this for 2 target.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/235155-malefic-grasp" target="_blank">Malefic Grasp</a>:</u></strong> Considerably nurfed with 7.2.5, its still ahead of the other two on single target, but only by a few percent.  The strength in this will come in situations where you can sit and tunnel with multiple agonies and corruptions out for shards for large Unstable Affliction drains. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> This tier has been considerable scaled flat with the 7.2.5 changes.  The 20% damage buff to all spells allowed for a considerable scaledown of both Malefic Grasp and Writhe to allow haunt to shine without actually buffing haunt to overpowered land.  While the new haunt is definitely close in single target, the only time it will have considerable play will be in times where you can reset the cooldown, or when you have so much movement on single target that Malefic Grasp will just not be useful.  Outside of this <i>highly unlikely</i> situation, its a choice of 3targets -> WiA, 2 or less -> MG. MG is only 4-5% ahead depending on legendaries. Haunt and Writhe are both going to see a lot of play anytime there's moderate-high movement on a fight, even for ST. Guldan for example.</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 30:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196105-contagion" target="_blank">Contagion</a>:</u></strong> Increases damage delt to targets effected by contagion by 15%. 7.2.5 put this back to 15%, but its still incredibly strong for single and 2 target.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196103-absolute-corruption" target="_blank">Absolute Corruption</a>:</u></strong> Makes Corruption permanent (or 40 seconds in PVP) and makes it do 25% more damage. Lots of situations where this lets you drop a DOT from your rotation, really smoothing out rotations involving Malefic Grasp or on multiple targets.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/235157-empowered-life-tap" target="_blank">Empowered Life Tap</a>:</u></strong> This is a maintennce buff tied to life tap, increasing all damage delt by 10%. This is a strong talent for AOE and for when you aren’t necessarily going to be choosing malefic grasp.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Empowered Life Tap is immediately ruled out due to terrible play it promotes, and because the other two will provide more damage on correct targets in most realistic situations.  Contagion is for single target, or when you have a consistant pressure target to apply damage to, as well as it is definitely stronger on 2 target than AC (not by much).  AC is for when you will be consistantly maintaining 3 targets or more worth of dots, because it completely removes a dot from your rotation.  Remember that seed of corruption applies corruption, so there are many cases where AC is a trap on add fights where one seed would apply the corruptions instead.</p>
    <p>ELT is very good for M+ because it's the best for scaling seed/sf. AC is ahead on 2t for MG, you spend too many gcds otherwise and its worth applying all dots on both targets at 25% MG. As soon as you consistently need to dot more than 1t ac is better for mg. Writhe isn't until 3t sustained because drain soul matters less.</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 45:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48018-demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a>:</u></strong> Spell is almost the same, except now you need to create a cancel aura macro to make it work properly. See Macros section for more info on this.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108396-mortal-coil" target="_blank">Mortal Coil</a>:</u></strong> Works exactly as it does on live, including not healing or doing damage to bosses.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/5484-howl-of-terror" target="_blank">Howl of Terror</a>:</u></strong> AOE fear instead of getting shadowfury. Very sad. But hey, at least it’s an instant cast... Unlike shadowfury...</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Demonic Circle is now baseline as it’s ever been since June 2016. Mortal Coil has some uses in Mythic+ as it does not share the same DR as stuns. Howl of Terror is almost only useable to proc Sephuz if you have the legendary (it is off of the GCD).  In raids take Circle, in M+ take Mortal Coil unless you need the circle (or don't care to respec)</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 60:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205179-phantom-singularity" target="_blank">Phantom Singularity</a>:</strong></u> "Burst AOE" option for tier 60.  Recieved a Cooldown drop so that you can actually use it on most fights (Most boss fights have adds on 40-45 second spawn) and a damage increase so its actually strong on single target as well.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196226-sow-the-seeds" target="_blank">Sow the Seeds</a>:</u></strong> "Sustained AOE" option for tier 60.  Lets your Seed embed in 2 more targets, for 3 explosions, trippling the seed damage per cast.  Extremely strong in Mythic + and in many raid situations.</li>
        <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196098-soul-harvest" target="_blank">Soul Harvest</a>:</strong></u> "Burst Single Target" option for tier 60.  This lets you get a solid damage amp to get past a burn requirement on a target, or to just rack up with a Wrath of Consumption buff.  This will pull ahead of Phatom Singularity on single target if you can consitantly time it with a 5 stack of WoC and can get enough duration out of the spell.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> This tier is incredibly strong in terms of what to do.  Mythic + you typically want Sow the Seeds, and then raids typically use Phantom Singularity on most fights, with Soul Harvest being a boon if you can get a fat UA or multiple sustained UA + MG out with it.</p>
    <p>SH is still mostly good for ST burst and fights where you can abuse well timed WoC stacks - think of Tichondrius or Krosus for example.</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 75:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/219272-demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a>:</u></strong> Causes your Soul Leech to passively regen over time, and provides an absorb shield up for up to 20% of your max HP. <strong>7.1</strong><i>Not really a 7.1 note, but REMEMBER soul leech is a 15% shield that generates from your damage. This move is NOT as bad as presumed.</i></li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/111400-burning-rush" target="_blank">Burning Rush</a>:</u></strong> Copy Pasta ability from live, handy on fights that give a slow debuff (cenarius).</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108416-dark-pact" target="_blank">Dark Pact</a>:</u></strong> Works like Sacrificial Pact on live. Awesome damage reduction Cooldown.</li>
    </ul><strong>Verdict:</strong> This is a fight by fight, depending on the damage reduction, or Burning Rush. Any fight that has a reliable burst of damage every minute (IE: Ursoc charge) take Dark Pact. If the fight has any major mechanics that wreck your mobility (Cenarius dryads) or for mythic+ dungeons to make sure you go very fast, take Burning Rush. Demon Skin is an excellent spell for moderate sustain damage (Cenarius is again an excellent example)

        <p><strong>Tier 90:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152107-grimoire-of-supremacy" target="_blank">Grimoire of Supremacy</a>:</strong></u> Gives you the ability to summon your Doomguard / Infernal as permanent pets instead of 3 min cooldowns. Doomguard has an interrupt and massive slow, and Infernal has an offensive dispel and an AoE stun. Infernal has been buffed significantly from the WoD version and is now a decent option for aoe damage. The biggest benefit with this talent is your ability to swap from single target to aoe inbetween pulls as needed in an instance, which is very powerful in mythic + dungeons where you cannot swap talents.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108501-grimoire-of-service" target="_blank">Grimoire of Service</a>:</u></strong> Gives you a cooldown every minute and a half, giving you (Generally) a bonus Felhunter that deals twice damage that the standard one deals. This does cost a shard so it’s kind of annoying to use on single target. <strong>NOTE: GoServ Felhunter will interrupt when it spawns, giving you a bonus interrupt in Mythic+</strong></li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108503-grimoire-of-sacrifice" target="_blank">Grimoire of Sacrifice</a>:</u></strong> This has been dramatically changed from the WoD version. Legion Sacrifice causes ALL spells to periodically pulse for aoe damage, and it does quite a bit of damage. This is a great option to gain passive cleave damage for sacrificing a single target cooldown. The only downside is that you will be losing your pet Command Demon ability, specifically losing your only interrupt.</li>
    </ul><strong>Verdict:</strong> You will always be running Supremacy in 7.2.5, and swapping between Infernal with 3+ targets (or when you need the stun) and Doomguard (also used when you need the interrupt).

        <p><strong>Tier 100:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/234876-deaths-embrace" target="_blank">Death's Embrace</a>:</u></strong> New Talent replacing Soul Effigy.  This is a ramping execute, with 0% damage added at 35%, all the way to 50% bonus damage at 0%.  When you have a boss such as star augur with a "Last phase enrage" this talent makes even shadowpriests cry.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/63106-siphon-life" target="_blank">Siphon Life</a>:</u></strong> Swapped places with Phantom Singularity, its now our go to "General Signle Target" as well as a super strong Multi Target talent.  Just a raw amount of damage and bonus healing to boot.</li>
        <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/215941-soul-conduit" target="_blank">Soul Conduit</a>:</strong></u> Extremely RNG dependant to get any real milage out of this.  This allows you to continue the old "MG SH" style of play, adding extra soul shards, but still extremely RNG dependant. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> While the extra shards <b>can</b> provide massive increases, other times Conduit really doesn't proc when needed, and is highly reccomended against in most raiding situations.  That leaves a choice between Siphon Life and Death's Embrace.  The choice here should come from what the fight requires, and even on fights where DE is needed for phased enrage checks, running SL during the "initial" part of progression can help out a ton due to the healing and mobility it provides.</p>

    <p><strong><span style="font-size:30px">Recommended Talent Builds</span></strong></p>
    <p>7.2.5 added a lot of balance in the talent tree, allowing for a wide array of builds.</p>
    <p><strong>Heroics, Mythic+9 and lower:</strong></p>  <x-talent talent="1102012" spec="Affliction"></x-talent> <p>This is hands down your bread and butter "Jack of all trades" build, allowing for strong burst, aoe, and mobility.  Remember to try to use haunt to get 6-9 seconds of duration from its debuff so you can continually chain to reset it.</p>
    <p><strong>Mythic +10 and higher:</strong></p> <x-talent talent="3102012" spec="Affliction"></x-talent> <p>Main Difference here is the dropping of Haunt for Malefic Grasp, which is extremly handy on mini bosses during Fortified weeks, or for Bosses on Tyranical weeks, where you really need the extra bit of single target.  Sow the Seeds is still taken because the damage from it is still absurd compared to trying to sustain multi dotting and pulling off the occasional Soul Harvest or Phantom Singularity.</p>
    <p><strong>General Purpose Raid Build:</strong></p> <x-talent talent="3101012" spec="Affliction"></x-talent> <p>This build gives you super solid single target, the best "Sustained" tallent form Tier 60, as well as the ability to help with AOE burst on bosses / trash.</p>
    <p><strong>Hypster Multi Target Padding:</strong></p> <x-talent talent="2203012" spec="Affliction"></x-talent> <p>Considerably strong on 3target boss fights, as well as very well suited for consistant sustained dot pressure.  Remember to not shard cap while playing this spec.</p>
    <p><strong>Beat the last phase enrage timer:</strong></p> <x-talent talent="3103011" spec="Affliction"></x-talent> <p>This is added to give an idea as to what to do with Death's Embrace.  The single target of this build compared to General Purpose Raiding is a bit lower, but it will pay off in divedens on the progress boss.  If the phase is 2.5 minutes, be sure to use a Soul Harvest right at the start, but ALWAYS have soul harvest ready for the last 15-20 seconds for the fattest of damages.</p>
