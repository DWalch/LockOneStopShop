<h2>What does this stat do?</h2>
<p>Haste - Haste is your strongest stat as a Destruction Warlock. Haste makes everything faster, most importantly reducing the cooldown on conflagrate.</p>
<p>
Crit - Incinerate and Immolate both generate more shards from critical strikes. Also your Critical Strike makes your Chaos Bolt hit harder as this spell is a guaranteed crit already.</p>
<p>Versatility - A weaker, but entirely passive, version of mastery.</p>
<p>Mastery - Passively increases your damage and reduces your damage taken, in addition to a random component. In 7.2.5 they made mastery considerably less RNG, most of it's value is now passive..</p>
<p>Obviously the precise stat weights are gonna vary a lot depending on your gear, talents and obviously the fight itself. This segment of the guide is just made to give you a general idea of what stats you should be aiming for.</p>
