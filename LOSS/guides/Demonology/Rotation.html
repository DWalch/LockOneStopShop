The following is using this spec: [URL="https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/demonology/cke"]DC/ID/HoD/GoServ/DB or Darkglare[/URL]. The reason it's between Demonbolt and Darkglare is because they are both viable depending on the situation; if there is a single priority target (such as the boss) that needs to be killed but there is also another target that is cleaved lightly, take Demonbolt. If the two targets are equally as important to kill take Darkglare.
