    <p>Now for the big announcement of legion, the Artifact. The Affliction artifact is <strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/128942-ulthalesh-the-deadwind-harvester" target="_blank"><span style="color: =#E5CC80">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester</span></a></u></strong> and it looks pretty sick. The artifact revolves around Souls periodically spawning from your damaging spells, and your ability to consume them to amplify the artifact’s passive and provide a damage boost, increasing in duration based on your souls consumed. There’s no cooldown to this, it’s only limited by your number of souls. The artifact also comes with cool things, <span class="xbbcode-s">Gems</span>Relics and a full blown <span class="xbbcode-s">Time Sink</span>Talent System built in! The relics increase the artifact’s item level, and provide a level in a specific Trait for the artifact. The Deadwind Harvester's primary ability is called <strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216698-reap-souls?artifactRank=1" target="_blank">Reap Souls</a></strong>, and is the core around how this spec is played. Periodically, souls will escape from the harvester, allowing you to consume them to increase your power and amplify the power of the Deadwind Harvester during the duration of Reap Souls.</p>
    <p>Luckily its not all doom and gloom.  The affliction warlock artifact scales incredibly well, allowing you to min/max your damage in super strong ways.   Here is a crash course in the artifact.</p>

        <strong><span style="font-size:40px">Intro to <u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/128942-ulthalesh-the-deadwind-harvester" target="_blank"><span style="color: =#E5CC80">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester</span></a></u></span></strong>
    </div>
    <p>
      First thing to know is that <u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/128942-ulthalesh-the-deadwind-harvester" target="_blank"><span style="color: =#E5CC80">Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester</span></a></u> is how your artifact power <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216698-reap-souls" target="_blank">Reap Souls</a> works.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>First, there are <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216695-tormented-souls" target="_blank">Tormented Soul</a> that will periodically appear as you deal damage to targets.  These spawn at 5 RPPM.  These will appear as little purple balls floating around your charactor. </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216695-tormented-souls" target="_blank">Tormented Soul</a> will also spawn each time a mob dies that you have tagged.  This means as long as you have dealt damage to it, or hit it with a dot (even if the dot hasn't done damage), a soul will appear.  These will appear as the ghost of the mob you have recently killed.  <b>A KILLING BLOW IS NOT REQUIRED FOR THIS EFFECT</b> </li>
      <li> The <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216695-tormented-souls" target="_blank">Tormented Soul</a> buff will stack up to 12 stacks, and each individual <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216695-tormented-souls" target="_blank">Tormented Soul</a> will last about 1-2 minutes.  The timer doesn't seem to be exact, but know that they will eventually go away if unused, weather in or out of combat.</li>
      <li>Hitting <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216698-reap-souls" target="_blank">Reap Souls</a> will consume all <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216695-tormented-souls" target="_blank">Tormented Soul</a>s, applying the <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216698-reap-souls" target="_blank">Reap Souls</a> buff for 5 seconds base per soul consumed, increasing all damage you deal by 10%, and doubling certain effects of all artifact traits that you have access to.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here’s a preview of the really important traits for Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester. I will also include info as to what the amplification effect is.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199158-perdition" target="_blank">Perdition</a>:</u></strong> increases Crit scaling and provides bonus damage, this is a strong bonus even at lower crit levels especially since it applies to the vast majority of our damage outside aoe. <u>Amplification: doubles this to 20%</u></li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199472-wrath-of-consumption" target="_blank">Wrath of Consumption</a>:</u></strong> while this trait is hit and miss, if you have lots of adds dying, this can really stack up quick. This will trigger when any add you have threat on dies. Any fight where you’re going to have adds dying is a fight that the Affliction Lock is going to shine very nicely, especially with single target boss fight. <u>Amplification: Doubles the damage provided by the effect</u></li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199471-soul-flame" target="_blank">Soul Flame</a>:</u></strong> This is another gold tier trait, and this trait is the hidden sleeper of this tier. This deals damage when an add dies that you have any amount of threat on, and it’s quite a bit of damage. Super strong in dungeons and raids with adds (Scorpion is a huge ringer) <u>Amplification: Doubles the damage dealt</u></li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/201424-harvester-of-souls" target="_blank">Harvester of Souls</a>:</u></strong> This gives you damage equal to about 2 extra ticks of corruption over the duration, or 2 extra ticks every 7 ticks with absolute corruption. Cool trait, but not super exciting, definitely the weakest of the gold traits. <u>Amplification: Doubles the proc rate, raising it to 4 extra ticks per 7 ticks</u></li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199257-fatal-echoes" target="_blank">Fatal Echoes</a>:</u></strong> Kind of cool, but it’s very low RNG so it’s not even remotely reliable until you're in a place you’re able to spam UA on things. It can only proc once when an entire UA effect expires, not per UA cast. <u>Amplification: Proc Rate is doubled to 12%</u></li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/238072-winnowing" target="_blank">Winnowing</a>:</u></strong> Increases dot crit chance by 1% per rank, up to 4% base, 7% with full relics. <u>Amplification: Total increase up to 8% base, 14% if full relics</u></li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199152-inherently-unstable" target="_blank">Inherently Unstable</a>:</u></strong> Increases your UA crit by 2% per rank, up to 8% base, and 14% with full relics. <u>Amplification: Total increase up to 16% base, 24% if full relics</u></li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/238144-rend-soul" target="_blank">Rend Soul</a>:</u></strong> Gives damage from <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198590-drain-soul" target="_blank">Drain Soul</a> an additional chance to generate a <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216695-tormented-souls">Tormented Soul</a> <u>Amplification: 8% proc chance.  <b>Damage is unmodified by reap</b></u></li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199163-shadowy-incantations" target="_blank">Shadowy Incantations</a>:</u></strong> Increases all shadow damage by 1% per rank, 4% base max, up to 7% with full relics.  <u>Amplification: Total increase up to 8% base, 14% if full relics</u></li>

    </ul>

        <strong><span style="font-size:40px">Leveling your artifact???</span></strong>

    <p>This is the artifact path for your leveling and while you start on the gearing process.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Once you have leveled through to <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/238144-rend-soul" target="_blank">Rend Soul</a>, you can begin to fill the 3/4 traits to 4/4, allowing for the power of the affliction warlock to really spring forward.  I reccomend using this order:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199158-perdition" target="_blank">Perdition</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199163-shadowy-incantations" target="_blank">Shadowy Incantations</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199152-inherently-unstable" target="_blank">Inherently Unstable</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199111-inimitable-agony" target="_blank">Inimitable Agony</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199112-hideous-corruption" target="_blank">Hideous Corruption</a></li>

        <strong><span style="font-size:40px">Relic Choices</span></strong>
    </div>
    <p>As of 7.2.5, all relics are roughly equal in power where only <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199120-drained-to-a-husk" target="_blank">Drained to a Husk</a> is lower rated.  Because of this, <b>Always get the relic that has the highest item level</b></p>
    <p>If you absolutely must at least <b>FEEL</b> like you are min maxing, here is the approximate item level equivelent, and ranking.  All relic item levels are listed in a 905 -> 910 is 5 relic item level bumps.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199163-shadowy-incantations" target="_blank">Shadowy Incantations</a> + 0 relic item level</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199158-perdition" target="_blank">Perdition</a> + 0 relic item level</li>
