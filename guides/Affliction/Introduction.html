	<p>Welcome to the Legion Affliction Guide! I am Terryn and I will be your tour guide here today. I main warlock for the US guild Crisp of Baelgun, where I dot things and raid lead, and have played warlock off and on since TBC. In my free time you can find me on the warlock discord, playing some Dotes, working on my masters in software engineering, and fixing Gahddo's mistakes in simcraft. You can follow my conversations about Dota on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/Terryn_Fred" target="_blank">@TerrynFred</a> and follow my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/TerrynFred" target="_blank">youtube</a> where I will be releasing some more guides for Affliction. Iâ€™d also like to give a special thanks to Woundini for the kick ass banners! Be sure to follow him <a href="https://twitter.com/SSpelorzi" target="_blank">@sspelorzi</a>. Other props to Not, Peter, Bear, Rez, and Pyre for dealing with my horrendous spelling while giving this a few checks.</p>
	<p>Visual Guide for youtube for 7.2.5 will be coming <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=soon%20%28tm%29" target="_blank">SoonTM</a>! Check it out, it should help explain things that aren't quite as clear in this text. You can also check out my guide on <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/affliction-warlock-guide" target="_blank">wowhead</a>. The information there and here is the same, but their formatting may appeal to other people. The Affliction warlock has gone through some pretty drastic changes from through legion, with 7.0 -> 7.1.0 being entirely based around our dots, moving from a drain / tunnel spec with 7.1.5 and 7.2.0, and now to a playstyle that allows for both to happen, allowing a vast amount of flexibility and adaptation with the new TOS fights. </p>
	<p>Affliction's Strengths:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Extremely strong spread damage</li>
		<li> Single target damage that scales off of adds with <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199472-wrath-of-consumption" target="_blank">Wrath of Consumption</a> </li>
		<li> Extremely strong multi target that rivals even the master of cleave, Destruction</li>
		<li> Incredible mobility with a large swath of our damage coming from instant cast dots.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Affliction's Weaknesses:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Best damage reduces mobility duraing a fight to a minimum</li>
		<li> Very long ramp-up time and poor burst damage.</li>
		<li> Some RNG aspects involved with <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216695-tormented-souls" target="_blank">Tormented Soul</a> can be very frustrating on single target</li>
		<li> Reliant on multiple targets to get the most out of single target</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Please check back for an updated FAQ in the near future. In the mean time if you have a submission please enter it in a comment through Discus or message any one of the LOSS team members!</strong></p>


	<p><strong>Q: Is Affliction Viable?!"</strong>
	</p>


	<p><i>A: Yes! We are sub par on Ursoc, Nythendra, and Guarm, and (from the looks of things) Mythic Helya, however we are absoutely fine on everything else, and tend to Excel on every fight that ISN'T those two. As of 7.1.0 if you have the legendary helm or belt you should be, while not the BEST <a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/wLGJ9HF3rxcQv6zt#fight=33&type=damage-done" target="_blank">completely viable</a></i>
	</p>



	<p><strong>Q: WHY IS CRIT SIMMING HIGHER THAN MASTERY AND HASTE?</strong>
	</p>


	<p>A: <i>This is almost entirely because of perdition. Perdition: This gives us 15% more crit damage on our everything minus Drain, 30% under reap. This massively inflates crits value above everything until almost 30% crit. <u><strong>THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU SHOULD STACK CRIT, BUT MAINTAIN A HEALTHY BALANCE OF CRIT / HASTE WITH CRIT BEING SLIGHTLY HIGHER WHILE MAINTAINING 100+% MASTERY.</strong></u></i></p>


	<p><strong>Q: Why is mastery simming so LOW?! You said stack mastery! wtf!</strong>
	</p>


	<p>A: <i>This can be explained ether the tldr or the long way. TLDR: Because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N6cOC2P8fQ" target="_blank">math</a>, mastery falls off at about 100% <strong>HOWEVER THERE IS NO SOFT CAP OR HARD CAP. MASTERY ABOVE THIS IS FINE</strong> <strong>Math: WARNING IN HERE BE MATH DRAGONS:</strong></i><br></p>


	<div style="margin-left:10px">
		<i>As you get more mastery, the actual effectiveness of mastery goes down. Take for example a 5% mastery gain at 10% mastery on a spell that deals 100 damage: Old mastery: 10% Total Damage: 110 New Mastery: 15% Total Damage: 115 Damage Gain: about 4.5% We then look at the same damage change going from 120% mastery to 125% mastery: Old Mastery: 110% Total Damage: 210 New Mastery: 115% Total Damage: 215 Damage Gain: 2.3% All of this is because mastery applies to the base value of the dot, and 1% isn't always 1%. If you were to look at an (approximately) equal crit gain of ~1.5%, that starts to pull ahead of 2.3%. Other issues involve item stat budgets and how items gain stats going up in itemlevel. The same item going from 850 to 880 will only gain about 100 secondary stats, but will gain about 400+ intellect. This means there is also a (relative) soft cap as to how many secondary stats we can accumulate in legion</i>
	</div>


	<p><strong>Q: OMG OUR SURVIVABILITY HAS BEEN BUTCHERED IN 715. WHY DID BLIZZARD NURF OUR SELF HEALING FROM DRAIN?!?!?!</strong>
	</p>


	<p>A: <i>Judging by the logs I've got for PTR to live Drain, Drain Soul is almost a carbon copy of drain life in damage and healing.</i><br>
	<i><strong>DISCLAIMER: THESE LOGS WERE NOT DONE BY THE SAME PERSON, BUT WAS DONE WITH APPROXIMATELY SIMILAR GEAR. HOWEVER: The numbers are close enough that we can basically assume nothing is changing</strong></i><br>
	<i><a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/dzfYk2a76QDTKBpX#fight=7&type=healing&source=49&options=8&ability=689" target="_blank">Live Healing</a></i><br>
	<i><a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/LHaj61dPQCJDXmrx#type=healing&source=4&options=8&ability=198590" target="_blank">PTR Healing</a></i><br>
	<i><a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/dzfYk2a76QDTKBpX#fight=7&type=damage-done&source=49&ability=689" target="_blank">Live Damage</a></i><br>
	<i><a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/reports/LHaj61dPQCJDXmrx#type=damage-done&source=4&ability=198590" target="_blank">PTR Damage</a></i><br>
	<i><strong>TLDR: WE HAVE HAD LITERALLY 0 CHANGE IN SELF HEAL FROM DRAIN LIFE TO DRAIN SOUL, AS WELL AS 0 CHANGE IN DAMAGE FOR DRAIN LIFE TO DRAIN SOUL</strong></i></p>


	<p><strong>Q: WHAT ARE OUR STAT WEIGHTS!???</strong>
	</p>


	<p>A: <i>I would like to direct you to a website called <a href="https://simulationcraft.org/" target="_blank">https://simulationcraft.org/</a> There you can download the software to find your own weights. I will not be listing them up to date BECAUSE with literally billions of gear combinations, its impossible for me to give an accurate stat weight for you. The best action would be after the end of a raid where you got a new piece of gear, grab the latest build of simcraft, import your charactor, and run it yourself. That is the only way to get a remotely accurate stat weight.</i></p>-->
