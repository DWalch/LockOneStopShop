[B]Final Thoughts[/B]

With the recent legendary balancing done in patch 7.2 a lot of legendaries that before weren't competitive are now a lot better.
[url=http://www.wowdb.com/items/132456-feretory-of-souls][color="#ff8000"]Feretory of Souls[/color][/url] + [url=http://www.wowdb.com/items/144369-lessons-of-space-time][color="#ff8000"]Lessons of Space-Time[/color][/url] is the optimal legendary combination for single target.
[url=http://www.wowdb.com/items/132456-feretory-of-souls][color="#ff8000"]Feretory of Souls[/color][/url] + [url=http://www.wowdb.com/items/132407-magistrike-restraints][color="#ff8000"]Magistrike Restraints[/color][/url] is the best legendary combination for cleave.

The most important legendary as Destruction is [url=http://www.wowdb.com/items/132456-feretory-of-souls][color="#ff8000"]Feretory of Souls[/color][/url] and this should be used in all situations. For a ranking of how legendaries perform go look under the "Sims" section.

[B]Trinkets[/B]

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/items/140809-whispers-in-the-dark][color="#a335ee"]Whispers in the Dark[/color][/url] is a proc trinket that increases your haste for 12 seconds, once this expires your haste is decreased for 8 seconds. This trinket is extremely strong as your Soul Shard generation increases drastically when up. This trinkets value increases a lot on more than 1 target. 
[url=http://www.wowdb.com/items/140792-erratic-metronome][color="#a335ee"]Erratic Metronome[/color][/url] makes your spells have a chance to increase your haste, this effect stacks but stacking it does not refresh the buff. Essentially this works a bit like a stat stick intellect + haste trinket. 
[url=http://www.wowdb.com/items/142507-brinewater-slime-in-a-bottle][color="#a335ee"]Brinewater Slime in a Bottle[/color][/url] is also a very strong option if able to get a good version. Obviously other stat stick trinkets have the same value as this, but it may be easier obtaining a higher item level trinket from Helya than from a world quest.
Aswell as with legendaries, you can go to the "Sims" section in order to see rankings of how the various trinkets perform.
