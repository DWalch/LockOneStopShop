[size=4]Welcome to our very own Lock One Stop Shop![/size]

[size=3]Here you will find guides and sims of every kind for all Warlock specs.

On the left will be your navigation guide to each spec with their respective guides and sims included, please use it freely and liberally![/size]

The intention of this site is to have an easy and accessible place for all your Warlock needs for learning and sims instead of having to go to 3, 4 or more places. If you find anything to not work, have a question about functionality or have any other questions feel free to contact myself (Not) or anyone else on the LOSS team and they'd be happy to try and answer any questions you might have.

There are multiple people involved in this project and I'd like to take a moment to briefly thank them all for the contributions;
- Saocow: HTML, CSS, JavaScript wizard
- Sevvy: Chart and Spreadsheet math lady
- Allaf: LOSS v1 contributor
- Woudini: Graphic design
- Terryn: Affliction guide writer
- Loozy: Destruction guide writer
- Gahddo/Motoko/Silver: Sim runners
- Me (Not): Demonology guide, sim runner, website mother
