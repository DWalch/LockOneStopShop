So with all of these abilities finally clarified, let’s get to the meat and potatoes of what you're doing with the Affliction spec.  There's quite a few play styles for Affliction, revolving around the level 100 talents and fight types, and I will try to cover most of them.  

[anchor]rotation_st[/anchor][CENTER][SIZE=4][U]First let’s look at single target:[/U][/SIZE][/CENTER]

[B]EFFIGY OPENER[/B]
Unfortunately the Affliction opener is pretty terrible, we will be waiting on our agony to ramp up to ~15-16 before doing anything
[list]
[*]Pre-pot and precast Effigy at 1.5-1 second, spam agony during cast to agony the target after effigy cast goes off (before auto target swap happens).
[*]Agony effigy.
[*]Remainder of dots on target, only casting corruption on effigy if you have AC.  Do not cast SL on effigy.
[*]Drain for 3-4 seconds.  We are waiting for 4th shard tick to happen
[*]Re-apply dots.
[/list]
At this point you should be at around 10+ stacks of agony, 4 shards, and [i]Hopefully[/i] have souls to begin your standard rotation:

[B]SOUL CONDUIT OPENER[/B]
Similar concept to effigy opener but different execution:
[list]
[*]Pre-pot on 1 (To avoid retards pulling early and screwing you out of your 2nd pot).
[*]Agony -> Corruption -> SL if talented on target.
[*]Agony any other secondary targets, and corruption any that will live long enough if talented for AC.
[*]Drain until a few seconds after the 4th shard is generated.
[*]Re-apply dots.
[*]Begin drain rotation if MG, if Writhe begin UA dump.
[/list]

[b]WITH MALEFIC GRASP[/b]
You will be going through various drain cycles which are as follows
[LIST]
[*]Drain until dots are inside pandemic range, fishing for more souls and a minimum of 2 shards.
[*]Re-dot dots.
[*]UA twice minimum, upwards of 4 times if there are conduit procs, you need to be at 3 shards or lower before continuing.
[*]Drain until all UA are gone.  If corruption or siphon fall off its fine, only stop draining for agony refreshes.
[/LIST]
Other things to note about MG Builds:
[LIST]
[*]Siphon on effigy is useless, and a damage loss, it should only be cast while moving and at full HP / other dots are refreshed.
[*]GCDs are very important, and you need to make sure to time dot refreshes down to the last second, or time them during your movement.
[*]Corruption should only be on the effigy if you are running AC.
[/LIST]

[b]WITH AC / WRITHE BUILD[/b]
[LIST]
[*]Maintain your Agony and Siphon on your main target and Effigy, refreshing them during the Pandemic Range..
[*]Only UA out of reap when you hit 5 shards.
[*]When you hit 3 souls, redot your targets, wait for 4 shards.  Upon getting 4 shards, redot all dots, hit reap, dump up to 5 UA (Shard should be generated at some point) into the target back to back and drain.  Your goal here is to get all 4 UA + a full Drain without having to redot all under reap effect.
[/LIST]

[SIZE=4]Some other situational notes to keep in mind:[/SIZE]

[CENTER][SIZE=4][U]When small adds are involved that need to be killed:[/U][/SIZE][/CENTER]
[LIST]
[*]Keep Agony and Corruption and Siphon on the target the boss and Effigy (if not MG).
[*]Save your UA for the kill target.  
[*]Drop 3-4UA, a Corruption, and then just Drain the target, highly effective when MG
[/LIST]

[CENTER][SIZE=4][U]Passive Add Cleave (Mythic Dragons for example) [/U][/SIZE][/CENTER]
[LIST]
[*]Follow standard MG / Writhe priority.
[*]If the add will definitely die in 10 or less seconds, only corruption.  The extra shard potential from Agony will not be as valuable as the raw damage from Corruption.
[*]If the target will die in 15+ seconds put full dots on it, and UA when the target has about 5 seconds left for shard free damage.  
[*]Always try to snipe drain souls for bonus UA if you’re not actually focusing on the target and you aren’t in the middle of a drain cycle.  Keep an eye on your shards and don’t over-do this, because your shard generation rate is going to go up and up over the Nighthold Raid progression.
[/LIST]

[anchor]rotation_aoe[/anchor][CENTER][SIZE=4][U]Raw AOE[/U][/SIZE][/CENTER]
This assumes you are some sort of AOE build involving Sow the Seeds.
[LIST]
[*]Precast Seed of Corruption.
[*]UA the target you cast seed on.  This will cause it to explode very quickly and the UA cast will finish just as the Seed of Corruption Lands.
[*]Agony 2 targets, then Seed of corruption Again.
[*]Agony the rest of your targets.
[*]From here alternate Seed, and then cast agony around while waiting on Seeds to explode.  
[/LIST]

[anchor]rotation_multitarget[/anchor][CENTER][SIZE=4][U]Multi Target Situations:[/U][/SIZE][/CENTER]

[b]Without MG[/b]
[LIST]
[*]If shard capped, cast UA.  UA has a higher Damage Per Cast (DPC) than Siphon Life.
[*]If targets are stacked, and there’s more than 3 together, it’s quicker on GCDs to cast seed of corruption (Even if untalented) to spread corruption.  2.5 second cast time, globals are 1.5 second base.
[*]Keep Corruption and Agony up on your targets
[*]Cast Unstable Affliction when you're at a 4 stack of Compound Horror or at 5 shards.  The target really depends on which target needs to be receiving damage right now.
[*]If you have the free GCDs put Siphon Life up and Drain Soul.
[*]If adds are stacked, and you have GoSac, make sure there are as many dots rolling as possible.
[*]If you have Sow the Seeds, spend free GCDs and shards on that.
[*] If you do not have Sow the Seeds, keep UA rolling on at least one target, and drain during down time for extra GoSac procs.
[/LIST]


[b]With MG[/b]
This is done in situations when you have a Boss kill target and you’re trying to eek out a bit extra damage with adds involved.
[list]
[*]Maintain all dots on your primary burn target
[*]If your shards are ever capped try to get into a drain cycle asap, get below 3 shards.
[*]If the add will NOT proc WOC and does NOT need your help to get killed, ignore the add.
[*]If the add must die in under 10 seconds, UA 2 times on the target and drain until death.  Be sure to pre-dot your previous kill target before this happens.  You should get at least 1 shard back from drain.  If the target will not die with a UA on it and will die in greater than 4 seconds, re-cast 1 UA and then drain until death for the UA Shard return.
[*]If the add must die, but will take longer than 10 seconds, apply full dots, and then begin drain cycles on it instead of your previous kill target.
[*]If the add will proc WOC and will live for 10+seconds agony them for bonus shards.
[*]If the add will proc WOC and will not live for 10 seconds, corruption them.
[/list]

[CENTER][SIZE=4][U]Reap Usage:[/U][/SIZE][/CENTER]
The entire affliction gameplay revolves around the usage of Reap, and correct usage of Reap can be the difference between green and purple parses.
MG Priority
[LIST]
[*]On pull, wait for re-dotting to be finished at 8 agony stacks, and pop to begin drain cycle.
[*]Save 6-10 souls for your 2nd potion timing (preferably 8+), you should be able to get an extra drain cycle every 4 souls (2 souls for 1 drain, 6 for 2, 10 for 3).  During potion,  if more souls have spawned, use reap immediately going into a drain.
[*]Otherwise, use reap any time you are about to enter a Drain cycle, with only one soul pop with your last UA cast.
[*]2 reap are required for 1 full drain cycle.
[*]if during re-dotting, 3+ souls appear in rapid succession, save for a 6 and pop for 2 full drain cycles.
[/LIST]
Writhe Priority
[LIST]
[*]On a Bloodlust pull when you hit ~15 stacks of agony, no matter how many souls you have.  If using the UA on pre-pull opener, this should happen right as you’re maxing shards.
[*]If you will be lusting at some point after the pull, make sure to have at least 8 souls for the lust duration.
[*]If you have a designated time to Potion during the pull, make sure to save 8+ souls for the potion if using Prolonged Power (10+ preferred).
[*]Burst phases: Any time there’s a requirement of a burst phase, hit the button.  It’s a minimum of 10% bonus damage, before all of the artifact amplifications.
[*]You hit 12 souls.   Any more is wasting resources.  Hit reap so you now have a 1 minute buff of your artifact.
[*]Large Wrath of Consumption stacks are a great time to reap.  If you're at the 5 stack, this raises it from a 10 to a 20% damage increase.  Wrath only stacks to 5, so make sure you're efficient with its up time and get as much out of it as possible.
[*]Lots of adds with Corruption and / or agony: This is a time where you can get a lot of Compounding Horror stacks.  Using reap will double this chance, giving you a flood of bonus damage to the point where you can almost spam UA at 25% bonus damage.
