While there are many addons out there, there are certainly a few that stick out as great ones, here are some that I highly recommend:
[LIST][*][URL="http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/weakauras-2"]Weak Auras 2[/URL]
[INDENT]The quintessential addon for tracking anything and everything there is in World of Warcraft. There are many places that you can find Weak Auras including:[/INDENT]

[*][URL="http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/doom-shards"]Doom Shards[/URL]
[INDENT]Doom Shards is an addon that allows you to track your Soul Shards like normal but has the added functionality of being able to predict/tell you when you will gain your next Soul Shard to avoid over capping.[/INDENT]
[*][URL="http://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/zpets"]zPets[/URL]
[INDENT]An addon developed by our lord and saviour Zinnin that is basically an all-in-one addon specifically for Demonology. It can relay all the important information you need to know in a compact area. Development of the addon is still in the works for more customization options but you can tie in aspects of zPets with Weak Auras making it an even greater tool to have.[/INDENT]
