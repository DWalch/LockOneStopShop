<h2>What does this stat do?</h2>
<p>Haste - Haste is your strongest stat as a Destruction Warlock. Haste provides the largest overall boost in Soul Shard generation due to more Immolate ticks and a lower cooldown of Conflagrate. Obviously more Shards = more Chaos Bolts = more damage.</p>
<p>Crit - Crit is your second best stat and this comes in second due to also attributing to your Soul Shard generation. Immolate crits have doubled chance of generating a Soul Shard. Also your Critical Strike makes your Chaos Bolt hit harder as this spell is a guaranteed crit already.</p>
<p>Versatility/Mastery - Both of these stats have kind of the same effect. Versatility grants you a constant percentage damage increase and Mastery makes your spells deal up to a percentage extra damage. This means Mastery can be really bad, but also make your spells hit very hard. However Versatility is generally better as it gives you more consistency between pulls.</p>
<p>Mastery will average out over numerous attempts, but you will still be able to see the dps you do vary depending on your mastery quite a bit if running high Mastery.</p>
<p>Obviously the precise stat weights are gonna vary a lot depending on your gear, talents and obviously the fight itself. This segment of the guide is just made to give you a general idea of what stats you should be aiming for.</p>
