These sims were done using the 908 iLvl BiS above - however the races translate in the same DPS difference across all iLvls.

It should definitely be noted with the removal of our old Demonic Leap, Goblins have a [B]huge[/B] potential for Horde Warlocks providing you with another movement ability on a 90 second cooldown. However overall the differences between races should be very minimal and you can safely play any of the races with success.
