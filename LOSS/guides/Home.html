<h1>Welcome to our very own Lock One Stop Shop!</h1>
<h2>Here you will find guides and sims of every kind for all Warlock specs. On the left will be your navigation guide to
    each spec with their respective guides and sims included, please use it freely and liberally!</h2>

<p>The intention of this site is to have an easy and accessible place for all your Warlock needs for learning and sims
    instead of having to go to 3, 4 or more places. If you find anything to not work, have a question about
    functionality or have any other questions feel free to contact myself (Not) or anyone else on the LOSS team and
    they'd be happy to try and answer any questions you might have.</p>
