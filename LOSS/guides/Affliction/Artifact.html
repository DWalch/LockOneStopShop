Legion will introduce a variety of new things, the most notable will be our Artifact: [B][U][URL="http://beta.wowdb.com/items/128942-ulthalesh-the-deadwind-harvester"][COLOR=#E5CC80]Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester[/COLOR][/URL][/U][/B], relics for the artifact, [URL="http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/216698-reap-souls"]Reap Souls[/URL], and, less important, our new Set Bonuses.  Overall, the 110 affliction warlock, as controversial as it has been, is definitely an improvement to the single target drain spec that we had in Warlords of Draenor.  Our new mechanics allow us to take advantage of add fights in multiple ways, adding to the new "Class Fantasy" that is a spec that consumes souls and drains the life from its enemies.

Now for the big announcement of legion, the Artifact.  The Affliction artifact is [B][U][URL="http://beta.wowdb.com/items/128942-ulthalesh-the-deadwind-harvester"][COLOR=#E5CC80]Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester[/COLOR][/URL][/U][/B] and it looks pretty sick.  The artifact revolves around Souls periodically spawning from your damaging spells, and your ability to consume them to amplify the artifact’s passive and provide a damage boost, increasing in duration based on your souls consumed.  There’s no cooldown to this, it’s only limited by your number of souls.  The artifact also comes with cool things, [s]Gems[/s]Relics and a full blown [s]Time Sink[/s]Talent System built in!  The relics increase the artifact’s item level, and provide a level in a specific Trait for the artifact. 
The Deadwind Harvester's primary ability is called [B][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/216698-reap-souls?artifactRank=1"]Reap Souls[/URL][/B], and is the core around how this spec is played.  Periodically, souls will escape from the harvester, allowing you to consume them to increase your power and amplify the power of the Deadwind Harvester during the duration of Reap Souls.

Here’s a preview of the really important traits for Ulthalesh, the Deadwind Harvester.  I will also include info as to what the amplification effect is.
[LIST]
[*][B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199282-compounding-horror"]Compounding Horror[/URL]: [/U][/B]Hands down the most important trait in the arsenal of the affliction weapon.  Deals instant damage for the UA cast, which is nice for bursting a target.  [U]Amplification: doubles the chaince to gain stacks of Compound Horror to 20%.[/U]
[*][B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199158-perdition"]Perdition[/URL]:[/U][/B] increases Crit scaling and provides bonus damage, this is a strong bonus even at lower crit levels especially since it applies to the vast majority of our damage outside aoe.  [U]Amplification: doubles this to 20%[/U]
[*][B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199472-wrath-of-consumption"]Wrath of Consumption[/URL]:[/U][/B] while this trait is hit and miss, if you have lots of adds dying, this can really stack up quick.  This will trigger when any add you have threat on dies.  Any fight where you’re going to have adds dying is a fight that the Affliction Lock is going to shine very nicely, especially with single target boss fight. [U]Amplification: Doubles the damage provided by the effect[/U]
[*][B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199471-soul-flame"]Soul Flame[/URL]:[/U][/B] This is another gold tier trait, and this trait is the hidden sleeper of this tier.  This deals damage when an add dies that you have any amount of threat on, and it’s quite a bit of damage.   Super strong in dungeons and raids with adds (Scorpion is a huge ringer)  [U]Amplification: Doubles the damage dealt[/U]
[*][B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/201424-harvester-of-souls"]Harvester of Souls[/URL]:[/U][/B] This gives you damage equal to about 2 extra ticks of corruption over the duration, or 2 extra ticks every 7 ticks with absolute corruption. Cool trait, but not super exciting, definitely the weakest of the gold traits.  [U]Amplification: Doubles the proc rate, raising it to 4 extra ticks per 7 ticks[/U]
[*][B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199257-fatal-echoes"]Fatal Echoes[/URL]:[/U][/B] Kind of cool, but it’s very low RNG so it’s not even remotely reliable until you're in a place you’re able to spam UA on things.  It can only proc once when an entire UA effect expires, not per UA cast. [U]Amplification: Proc Rate is doubled to 12%[/U]
[/LIST]


[CENTER][B][SIZE=4]How the hell do you level this thing???[/SIZE][/B][/CENTER]
So you have this talent system that you have to spend a lot of time putting points into it, so now the question is how do you put points into this thing?  Well, here’s a few recommended ways to build the artifact up so you can get the most bang for your buck.

[CENTER][B]3250 Artifact Power:[/B] [/CENTER]
[B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199472-wrath-of-consumption?artifactRank=1"]Wrath of consumption[/URL][/U][/B]: This should be the first thing you go towards.  This is by far the strongest ability we have in our arsenal and should be what you blast points into, providing a passive 10% (20% with reap) damage bonus for every add that dies that you have tagged (Some restrictions apply).  Along the way we are picking up UA Crit, Free Healthpot healthstones, and Perdition, which is one of the strongest traits we have as our gear starts to get stronger.

[B]33450 Artifact Power:[/B] [/CENTER]
Next, grab [B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199471-soul-flame?artifactRank=1"]Soul Flame[/URL][/U][/B].  This is super super strong for dungeons, and will probably be what you want to get for the whole "Gearing up" process.  Its really not as good in raids, as the adds have to be on a boss to really get any damage, but this will be super strong for anything going through mythics.  There are quite a few raids going into both the Nightmare and The Nighthold that you can take advantage of large add deaths to gain bonus boss damage with Soul Flame, as well as sweet sweet [url=http://imgur.com/a/fpo40]Padding[/url].  This path also finishes out your + Damage route, giving you your bonus Shadow damage%, as well as our bonus Corruption damage.

[B]276270 Artifact Power:[/B] [/CENTER]
From here you want to go to [B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/201424-harvester-of-souls?artifactRank=1"]Harvester of Souls[/URL][/U][/B].   This is the final gold trait, and is about a 3-4% damage bonus under a standard fight, as well as providing some basic healing during multi dot scenarios.  You also improve your agony on the way here, as well as the % return you get on your Soul Leach absorb.

[B]6851330 Artifact Power:[/B] [/CENTER]
From here there are two paths, both are ~ a 1% damage increase each: [url="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199257-fatal-echoes?artifactRank=1"]Fatal Echoes[/url] and [url="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199282-compounding-horror?artifactRank=1"]Compounding Horror[/url], which got a nurf going into 7.1 and making it drastically less important, especially with the emergence of the UA dump rotation.  Get one of these first, then the other, and fill out with [url="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199214-long-dark-night-of-the-soul?artifactRank=1"] Long Dark Night of the Soul[/url] as it provides 0 real damage increase.  After this, your final point begins your paragonning traits for a free 5% bonus damage.  [B]NOTE: THIS 5% DAMAGE TRAIT DOES NOT GET EFFECTED BY REAP[/b].

Note: This is just my recommended path.   There are other options available, and lots of filler traits that do quite a lot because of the reap mechanic.  Noteables secondary traits are:
