For Legion stats are fairly straight forward, currently it will look like this;
Single Target:
[LIST]
[*]Haste
[*]Intellect
[*]Critical Strike
[*]Mastery
[*]Versatility
[/LIST]
2+ Targets:
[LIST]
[*]Haste
[*]Intellect
[*]Critical Strike
[*]Versatility
[*]Mastery
[/LIST]
Generally speaking something with Haste and either Mastery or Critical Strike will be best.
[U][B]Intellect[/B][/U]
This is our primary stat, everything we do scales with it.
[U][B]Haste[/B][/U]
Haste rating increases the speed we cast, the rate our DoT ticks, the cast rate and attack speed of all your Demons; including your primary pet (Felguard), Wild Imps (summoned through Hand of Gul'dan), Dreadstalkers and Doomguard/Infernal. You will need 375 rating for 1% haste.
[U][B]Mastery[/B][/U]
Provides a damage % modifier for your Demonic Empowerment. In Legion each spec has a different modifier for the amount of rating needed per percent gain. For Demonology a 1% damage increase is 222 Mastery Rating. If you want to see the formula it's here:
[collapse][code]((SpecModifier*Rating)/400)/100[/code]
So to find 1% for Demonology:
[code]400/1.8=222.22[/code]
Which makes the calculation:
[code]((1.8*222.22)/400)/100 = 0.0099999 (and since Blizzard rounds up values like that....) = 1%[/code][/collapse]
[U][B]Critical Strike[/B][/U]
Increases your critical strike chance by 1% every 400 rating.
[U][B]Versatility[/B][/U]
Versatility is purposefully designed to be a flat DPS gain, it increases damage and healing and reduces damage taken by a flat %. To gain 1% versatility you need 475 rating.
