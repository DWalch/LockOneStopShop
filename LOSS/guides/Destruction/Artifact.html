[B]The Destruction Warlock Artifact Weapon[/B]

The Artifact Weapon Destruction Warlocks recieved in Legion is [url=http://www.wowdb.com/items/128941-scepter-of-sargeras][color=#E5CC80]Scepter of Sargeras[/color][/url] and this weapon grants us the spell [url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196586-dimensional-rift]Dimensional Rift[/url] which has 3 stacks on a 45 second recharge time. When casting Dimensional Rift you "rip a hole in time and space" and summon either a Unstable Tear, Shadowy Tear or a Chaos Tear. With 7.2 we also gained the golden trait that allows us to summon a Flame Rift. This rift is more powerful than the other ones. 

[B]The golden traits of the Destruction Artifact weapon are:[/B]

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/224103-lord-of-flames]Lord of Flames[/url] makes you summon an additional 3 infernals when casting Summon Infernal once every 10 minutes. This cooldown is reset upon death and also when resetting bosses. 

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/219195-conflagration-of-chaos]Conflagration of Chaos[/url] makes your Conflagrate have a chance to make your next Conflagrate a guaranteed crit and increases your Conflagrates critical damage.

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/219415-dimension-ripper]Dimension Ripper[/url] makes your Incinerate casts have a 5% chance to grant you a charge of Dimensional Rift

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/238146-flame-rift]Flame Rift[/url] makes your Dimensional Rift spell able to summon a Flame Rift.

[B]Other Notable Traits:[/B]

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/215273-impish-incineration]Impish Incineration[/url] is a very powerful trait that changes upon your talent choice. If you've specced into Grimoire of Service it increases the damage dealt by your Imp's Firebolt by 18%. When specced Grimoire of Supremacy it increases the damage of your Doomguard's Doombolt by 18% and finally when specced Grimoire of Sacrifice it increases the damage your Demon Power (the damage proc from the Grimoire of Sacrifice buff) by 50%. The strength of this trait is the reason you rush it when leveling up your artifact weapon.

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196432-burning-hunger]Burning Hunger[/url] increases the critical strike chance for your Immolate. This is very powerful as your Immolates periodic damage has a 15% chance to generate a Soul Shard, upon critical striking the chance is doubled. TL;DR - more Immolate crits = more shards = more Chaos Bolts.

[url=http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196236-soulsnatcher]Soulsnatcher[/url] gives Chaos Bolt a chance to refund 1 Soul Shard. Note that this shard is refunded to you once the Chaos Bolt hits the target. The reason this should be taken into consideration is that you'd be risking wasting a Soul Shard if generating one via. Immolate with Soulsnatcher proc if you cast Chaos Bolt at 4 or more shards.
