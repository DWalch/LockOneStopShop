    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong>

    With the recent legendary balancing done in patch 7.2 a lot of legendaries that before weren't competitive are now a lot better.
    <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132456-feretory-of-souls" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000"" >Feretory of Souls</span></a> + <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/144369-lessons-of-space-time" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000"" >Lessons of Space-Time</span></a> is the optimal legendary combination for single target.
    <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132456-feretory-of-souls" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000"" >Feretory of Souls</span></a> + <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132407-magistrike-restraints" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000"" >Magistrike Restraints</span></a> is the best legendary combination for cleave.

    The most important legendary as Destruction is <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132456-feretory-of-souls" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff8000"" >Feretory of Souls</span></a> and this should be used in all situations. For a ranking of how legendaries perform go look under the "Sims" section.

    <strong>Trinkets</strong>

    <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/140809-whispers-in-the-dark" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a335ee"" >Whispers in the Dark</span></a> is a proc trinket that increases your haste for 12 seconds, once this expires your haste is decreased for 8 seconds. This trinket is extremely strong as your Soul Shard generation increases drastically when up. This trinkets value increases a lot on more than 1 target.
    <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/140792-erratic-metronome" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a335ee"" >Erratic Metronome</span></a> makes your spells have a chance to increase your haste, this effect stacks but stacking it does not refresh the buff. Essentially this works a bit like a stat stick intellect + haste trinket.
    <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/142507-brinewater-slime-in-a-bottle" target="_blank"><span style="color: #a335ee"" >Brinewater Slime in a Bottle</span></a> is also a very strong option if able to get a good version. Obviously other stat stick trinkets have the same value as this, but it may be easier obtaining a higher item level trinket from Helya than from a world quest.
    Aswell as with legendaries, you can go to the "Sims" section in order to see rankings of how the various trinkets perform.
