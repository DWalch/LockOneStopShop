[B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/172-corruption"]Corruption[/URL]: [/U][/B]
No longer generates shards, it's now entirely a damage dot. 
[B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/980-agony"]Agony[/URL]:[/U][/B] 
New shard generator.  Still has the ramp up damage.  Shard generation has changed as well.  Shard generation is no longer based on a flat % chance to proc on tick, nor is it the ramping % chance to proc on tick that was present in alpha.  Instead every agony tick adds 0-32 invisible “soulbits”, and when you hit 100 soulbits you gain a shard.  You can still get bad shard RNG, but overall it is far more consistent than live. The amount gained per tick is reduced by the total number of agonies you have out, but it is still a large dps gain to have a lot of agony’s out.  The end result of this, is that your shard generation is not a linear result of how many agonies you have out, but has a logarithmic return on shard gen vs how many agonies you have out.

Our aoe spell.  Can be used baseline to spread corruption to multiple targets, and talented to deal 3x more damage.
[B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/30108-unstable-affliction"]Unstable Affliction[/URL]:[/U][/B] 
Shard consumer, now works like ignite.  When Unstable Affliction is re-applied to a target, the remaining damage of the previous dot is added into the new dot, making it so that you will never lose damage on this (Unless the target dies before hand).  A few notes on UA (Unstable Affliction):
[LIST]
[*]UA Does not gain bonus ticks from haste.
[*]UA only has 4 ticks total.
[*]Dot lasts 8 seconds, reduced by haste.
[*]Each cast of UA creates a separate dot on the boss.
[*]If a target dies before UA expires it refunds a shard.  Note: Only 1 shard is refunded per target, if with multiple UA on the target
[/LIST]
[B][U][URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198590-drain-soul"]Drain Soul[/URL]: [/U][/B]
Base “Filler” spell.  Heals for a lot, and deals ok-ish damage, and generates a soul shard if the target dies under its effect. [b]7.1.5 change:[/b] Drain Life has been replaced by Drain Soul.  The damage and healing of drain life has not changed, but now grants the shard mechanic of drain soul as baseline.
[U][B]Pandemic[/B][/U]: 
You'll see this term a lot when researching Warlock. Basically, it's a mechanic that allows you to refresh DoTs and 'add' the full duration as long as the DoT has <30% time remaining. This means you won't waste any DoT time as long as you refresh your DoTs under 30%

[B][SIZE=4]Pets[/SIZE][/B]
Our pet selection is pretty much [URL="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/691-summon-felhunter"]Summon Felhunter[/URL].  He gets bonus damage based on our dots, and gives us an interrupt.  If you're running Grimoire of Supremacy, you're going to run Doomguard in single target, giving you an interrupt and solid single target damage, or Infernal in 3+ targets, giving you solid bonus AOE, and an AOE stun on a 1 minute cooldown with Command Demon.
