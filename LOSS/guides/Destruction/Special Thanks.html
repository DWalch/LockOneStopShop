A number of things in this guide would not have been possible if it wasn't for the help of a number of people so thanks to you guys as well!
Silver for being my theorycrafting monkey that I could bounce ideas off of.
OOMM for making some of the most amazing Weak Auras so I don't have to stress over it!
Zinnin for developing zPets and making my life easy by answering many questions.
Woudini for the awesome new graphics!
Terryn & Gahhdo for making Simcraft work.
And to all my proof readers; Terryn, OOMM, Silver, Frescote, Woudini, Over - guide wouldn't have been the same without your input!
Sevvy for all the hard work they've done on all the many calculators and graphs!
