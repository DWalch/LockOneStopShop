</center>So with all of these abilities finally clarified, let’s get to the meat and potatoes of what you're doing with the Affliction spec. There's quite a few play styles for Affliction, revolving around the level 100 talents and fight types, and I will try to cover most of them. <a id="rotation_st" name="rotation_st"></a>
<center>
    <span style="font-size:40px"><u>First let’s look at single target:</u></span>
</center><strong>EFFIGY OPENER</strong><br> Unfortunately the Affliction opener is pretty terrible, we will be waiting on our agony to ramp up to ~15-16 before doing anything
<ul>
    <li>Pre-pot and precast Effigy at 1.5-1 second, spam agony during cast to agony the target after effigy cast goes off (before auto target swap happens).</li>
    <li>Agony effigy.</li>
    <li>Remainder of dots on target, only casting corruption on effigy if you have AC. Do not cast SL on effigy.</li>
    <li>Drain for 3-4 seconds. We are waiting for 4th shard tick to happen</li>
    <li>Re-apply dots.</li>
</ul>At this point you should be at around 10+ stacks of agony, 4 shards, and <i>Hopefully</i> have souls to begin your standard rotation: <strong>SOUL CONDUIT OPENER</strong><br> Similar concept to effigy opener but different execution:
<ul>
    <li>Pre-pot on 1 (To avoid retards pulling early and screwing you out of your 2nd pot).</li>
    <li>Agony -&gt; Corruption -&gt; SL if talented on target.</li>
    <li>Agony any other secondary targets, and corruption any that will live long enough if talented for AC.</li>
    <li>Drain until a few seconds after the 4th shard is generated.</li>
    <li>Re-apply dots.</li>
    <li>Begin drain rotation if MG, if Writhe begin UA dump.</li>
</ul><strong>WITH MALEFIC GRASP</strong><br> You will be going through various drain cycles which are as follows
<ul>
    <li>Drain until dots are inside pandemic range, fishing for more souls and a minimum of 2 shards.</li>
    <li>Re-dot dots.</li>
    <li>UA twice minimum, upwards of 4 times if there are conduit procs, you need to be at 3 shards or lower before continuing.</li>
    <li>Drain until all UA are gone. If corruption or siphon fall off its fine, only stop draining for agony refreshes.</li>
</ul>Other things to note about MG Builds:
<ul>
    <li>Siphon on effigy is useless, and a damage loss, it should only be cast while moving and at full HP / other dots are refreshed.</li>
    <li>GCDs are very important, and you need to make sure to time dot refreshes down to the last second, or time them during your movement.</li>
    <li>Corruption should only be on the effigy if you are running AC.</li>
</ul><strong>WITH AC / WRITHE BUILD</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Maintain your Agony and Siphon on your main target and Effigy, refreshing them during the Pandemic Range..</li>
    <li>Only UA out of reap when you hit 5 shards.</li>
    <li>When you hit 3 souls, redot your targets, wait for 4 shards. Upon getting 4 shards, redot all dots, hit reap, dump up to 5 UA (Shard should be generated at some point) into the target back to back and drain. Your goal here is to get all 4 UA + a full Drain without having to redot all under reap effect.</li>
</ul><span style="font-size:30px">Some other situational notes to keep in mind:</span>
<center>
    <span style="font-size:20px"><u>When small adds are involved that need to be killed:</u></span>
</center>
<ul>
    <li>Keep Agony and Corruption and Siphon on the target the boss and Effigy (if not MG).</li>
    <li>Save your UA for the kill target.</li>
    <li>Drop 3-4UA, a Corruption, and then just Drain the target, highly effective when MG</li>
</ul>
<center>
    <span style="font-size:20px"><u>Passive Add Cleave (Mythic Dragons for example)</u></span>
</center>
<ul>
    <li>Follow standard MG / Writhe priority.</li>
    <li>If the add will definitely die in 10 or less seconds, only corruption. The extra shard potential from Agony will not be as valuable as the raw damage from Corruption.</li>
    <li>If the target will die in 15+ seconds put full dots on it, and UA when the target has about 5 seconds left for shard free damage.</li>
    <li>Always try to snipe drain souls for bonus UA if you’re not actually focusing on the target and you aren’t in the middle of a drain cycle. Keep an eye on your shards and don’t over-do this, because your shard generation rate is going to go up and up over the Nighthold Raid progression.</li>
</ul><a id="rotation_aoe" name="rotation_aoe"></a>
<center>
    <span style="font-size:20px"><u>Raw AOE</u></span>
</center>This assumes you are some sort of AOE build involving Sow the Seeds.
<ul>
    <li>Precast Seed of Corruption.</li>
    <li>UA the target you cast seed on. This will cause it to explode very quickly and the UA cast will finish just as the Seed of Corruption Lands.</li>
    <li>Agony 2 targets, then Seed of corruption Again.</li>
    <li>Agony the rest of your targets.</li>
    <li>From here alternate Seed, and then cast agony around while waiting on Seeds to explode.</li>
</ul><a id="rotation_multitarget" name="rotation_multitarget"></a>
<center>
    <span style="font-size:20px"><u>Multi Target Situations:</u></span>
</center><strong>Without MG</strong>
<ul>
    <li>If shard capped, cast UA. UA has a higher Damage Per Cast (DPC) than Siphon Life.</li>
    <li>If targets are stacked, and there’s more than 3 together, it’s quicker on GCDs to cast seed of corruption (Even if untalented) to spread corruption. 2.5 second cast time, globals are 1.5 second base.</li>
    <li>Keep Corruption and Agony up on your targets</li>
    <li>Cast Unstable Affliction when you're at a 4 stack of Compound Horror or at 5 shards. The target really depends on which target needs to be receiving damage right now.</li>
    <li>If you have the free GCDs put Siphon Life up and Drain Soul.</li>
    <li>If adds are stacked, and you have GoSac, make sure there are as many dots rolling as possible.</li>
    <li>If you have Sow the Seeds, spend free GCDs and shards on that.</li>
    <li>If you do not have Sow the Seeds, keep UA rolling on at least one target, and drain during down time for extra GoSac procs.</li>
</ul><strong>With MG</strong><br> This is done in situations when you have a Boss kill target and you’re trying to eek out a bit extra damage with adds involved.
<ul>
    <li>Maintain all dots on your primary burn target</li>
    <li>If your shards are ever capped try to get into a drain cycle asap, get below 3 shards.</li>
    <li>If the add will NOT proc WOC and does NOT need your help to get killed, ignore the add.</li>
    <li>If the add must die in under 10 seconds, UA 2 times on the target and drain until death. Be sure to pre-dot your previous kill target before this happens. You should get at least 1 shard back from drain. If the target will not die with a UA on it and will die in greater than 4 seconds, re-cast 1 UA and then drain until death for the UA Shard return.</li>
    <li>If the add must die, but will take longer than 10 seconds, apply full dots, and then begin drain cycles on it instead of your previous kill target.</li>
    <li>If the add will proc WOC and will live for 10+seconds agony them for bonus shards.</li>
    <li>If the add will proc WOC and will not live for 10 seconds, corruption them.</li>
</ul>

    <span style="font-size:20px"><u>Reap Usage:</u></span>
</center>The entire affliction gameplay revolves around the usage of Reap, and correct usage of Reap can be the difference between green and purple parses.<br> <strong>MG Priority</strong><br>
<ul>
    <li>On pull, wait for re-dotting to be finished at 8 agony stacks, and pop to begin drain cycle.</li>
    <li>Save 6-10 souls for your 2nd potion timing (preferably 8+), you should be able to get an extra drain cycle every 4 souls (2 souls for 1 drain, 6 for 2, 10 for 3). During potion, if more souls have spawned, use reap immediately going into a drain.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, use reap any time you are about to enter a Drain cycle, with only one soul pop with your last UA cast.</li>
    <li>2 reap are required for 1 full drain cycle.</li>
    <li>if during re-dotting, 3+ souls appear in rapid succession, save for a 6 and pop for 2 full drain cycles.</li>
</ul><strong>Writhe Priority</strong>
<ul>
    <li>On a Bloodlust pull when you hit ~15 stacks of agony, no matter how many souls you have. If using the UA on pre-pull opener, this should happen right as you’re maxing shards.</li>
    <li>If you will be lusting at some point after the pull, make sure to have at least 8 souls for the lust duration.</li>
    <li>If you have a designated time to Potion during the pull, make sure to save 8+ souls for the potion if using Prolonged Power (10+ preferred).</li>
    <li>Burst phases: Any time there’s a requirement of a burst phase, hit the button. It’s a minimum of 10% bonus damage, before all of the artifact amplifications.</li>
    <li>You hit 12 souls. Any more is wasting resources. Hit reap so you now have a 1 minute buff of your artifact.</li>
    <li>Large Wrath of Consumption stacks are a great time to reap. If you're at the 5 stack, this raises it from a 10 to a 20% damage increase. Wrath only stacks to 5, so make sure you're efficient with its up time and get as much out of it as possible.</li>
    <li>Lots of adds with Corruption and / or agony: This is a time where you can get a lot of Compounding Horror stacks. Using reap will double this chance, giving you a flood of bonus damage to the point where you can almost spam UA at 25% bonus damage.</li>
</ul>
