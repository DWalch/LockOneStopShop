        <p><strong>Tier 15:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48181-haunt" target="_blank">Haunt</a>:</u></strong> While this talent has been 'nerfed' with the 7.2.5 patch, the relative strength of this talent compared to the other two has been considerably buffed. This will definitely have uses in mid to low end Mythic Plus, and fights where you need high ST add burst.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196102-writhe-in-agony" target="_blank">Writhe in Agony</a>:</u></strong> Defacto talent for any fight where you will be consitantly having 2+ targets with agony. Can also compete/beat MG on fights with <b>VERY</b> high movement.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/235155-malefic-grasp" target="_blank">Malefic Grasp</a>:</u></strong> Considerably nerfed with 7.2.5, it's still 4-6% ahead of the other two on single target, depending on your gear. Default choice for ST fights, and fights where your add damage doesn't matter.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> This tier was heavily nerfed in 7.2.5, as it's power level was absolutely insane. Affliction got a hefty flat damage increase to all spells to compensate. Haunt got nerfed around the time of patch release, and generally won't be a good choice for raiding. MG for ST fights, Writhe for cleave fights.</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 30:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196105-contagion" target="_blank">Contagion</a>:</u></strong> Increases damage delt to targets effected by contagion by 15%. 7.2.5 put this back to 15%, but its still incredibly strong for single and 2 target.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196103-absolute-corruption" target="_blank">Absolute Corruption</a>:</u></strong> Makes Corruption permanent (or 40 seconds in PVP) and makes it do 25% more damage. Lots of situations where this lets you drop a DOT from your rotation, really smoothing out rotations involving Malefic Grasp or on multiple targets.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/235157-empowered-life-tap" target="_blank">Empowered Life Tap</a>:</u></strong> This is a maintennce buff tied to life tap, increasing all damage delt by 10%. This is a strong talent for AOE and for when you aren’t necessarily going to be choosing malefic grasp.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Contagion is generally the best choice, providing a large increase to your ST and cleave. Absolute Corruption is strong on multiple fights this tier where you can abuse infinite duration corruptions (Demonic Inquisition and Desolate Host stand out). ELT is only useful for sustained AoE.</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 45:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48018-demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a>:</u></strong> Spell is almost the same as last expansion, except now you need to create a cancel aura macro to make it work properly. See Macros section for more info on this.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108396-mortal-coil" target="_blank">Mortal Coil</a>:</u></strong> Single Target horrify that also heals you. Never practical in raids.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/5484-howl-of-terror" target="_blank">Howl of Terror</a>:</u></strong> AOE fear instead of getting shadowfury. Very sad. But hey, at least it’s an instant cast... Unlike shadowfury...</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Demonic Circle is going to always be taken for raiding. Mortal Coil has some uses in Mythic+ as it does not share the same DR as stuns. Howl of Terror is almost only useable to proc Sephuz if you have the legendary (it is off of the GCD).  In raids take Circle, in M+ take Mortal Coil unless you need the circle (or don't care to respec)</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 60:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205179-phantom-singularity" target="_blank">Phantom Singularity</a>:</strong></u> Burst AOE option.  Recieved a Cooldown drop so that you can actually use it on most fights (Most boss fights have adds on 40-45 second spawn) and a damage increase so its actually strong on single target as well.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196226-sow-the-seeds" target="_blank">Sow the Seeds</a>:</u></strong> Sustained AOE option.  Lets your Seed embed in 2 more targets, for 3 explosions, trippling the seed damage per cast.  Extremely strong in Mythic + and in many raid situations.</li>
        <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196098-soul-harvest" target="_blank">Soul Harvest</a>:</strong></u> Burst Single Target option.  This lets you get a solid damage inrcease to get past a burn requirement on a target, or to just rack up with a Wrath of Consumption buff.  This will pull ahead of Phatom Singularity on single target if you can consitantly time it with a 5 stack of WoC or with multiple agonies out.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> This tier is incredibly strong in terms of what to do.  Mythic + you typically want Sow the Seeds, and anywhere there's sustained AoE. In raids you'll usually use Phantom Singularity. Soul Harvest is a good choice if you need burst or add spawns line up well to give you WoC synergy (think tichondrius or krosus).</p>

        <p><strong>Tier 75:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/219272-demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a>:</u></strong> Causes your Soul Leech to passively regen over time, and increases it's cap to 20% of your max HP.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/111400-burning-rush" target="_blank">Burning Rush</a>:</u></strong> Run fast, kill yourself. Healers hate this. Warlocks love it.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108416-dark-pact" target="_blank">Dark Pact</a>:</u></strong> Big bubble on a relatively small cooldown.</li>
    </ul><strong>Verdict:</strong> This will depend on the fight. In general you're safe to run Burning Rush, as warlocks are incredibly tanky baseline. If you feel you don't need the mobility, Demon Skin is good on fights with constant damage, and Dark Pact is good on fights with periodic large hits of damage.

        <p><strong>Tier 90:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152107-grimoire-of-supremacy" target="_blank">Grimoire of Supremacy</a>:</strong></u> Gives you the ability to summon your Doomguard / Infernal as permanent pets instead of 3 min cooldowns. Doomguard has an interrupt and massive slow, and Infernal has an offensive dispel and an AoE stun. Infernal has been buffed significantly from the WoD version and is now a decent option for aoe damage. The biggest benefit with this talent is your ability to swap from single target to aoe inbetween pulls as needed in an instance, which is very powerful in mythic + dungeons where you cannot swap talents.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108501-grimoire-of-service" target="_blank">Grimoire of Service</a>:</u></strong> Gives you a cooldown every minute and a half, giving you (Generally) a bonus Felhunter that deals twice damage that the standard one deals. This does cost a shard so it’s kind of annoying to use on single target. <strong>NOTE: GoServ Felhunter will interrupt when it spawns, giving you a bonus interrupt in Mythic+</strong></li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108503-grimoire-of-sacrifice" target="_blank">Grimoire of Sacrifice</a>:</u></strong> Causes ALL spells to have an RPPM-based chance to pulse for aoe damage, and it does quite a bit of damage.</li>
    </ul><strong>Verdict:</strong> You will always be running Supremacy in 7.2.5, and swapping between Infernal with 3+ targets (or when you need the stun) and Doomguard (also used when you need the interrupt).

        <p><strong>Tier 100:</strong></p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/234876-deaths-embrace" target="_blank">Death's Embrace</a>:</u></strong> New Talent replacing Soul Effigy.  This is a ramping execute, with 0% damage added at 35%, all the way to 50% bonus damage at 0%.  When you have a boss such as star augur with a "Last phase enrage" this talent makes even shadowpriests cry.</li>
        <li><strong><u><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/63106-siphon-life" target="_blank">Siphon Life</a>:</u></strong> Swapped places with Phantom Singularity, its now our go to talent for Writhe. Just a raw amount of damage and bonus healing to boot.</li>
        <li><u><strong><a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/215941-soul-conduit" target="_blank">Soul Conduit</a>:</strong></u> 20% chance to refund any shard spent. Strong in conjunction with MG, as well as for fights where you don't have enough globals to apply siphon lifes. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> DE is roughly the same dps as the other talents for any talent combination. However, it's all backended, meaning you want to run it on fights execute is important on (e.g. Desolate Host, Eye of Azshara M+). Many people feel the rotation plays better with MG if they take SC over SL, though sims do show that they're incredibly close. For Writhe you generally want to run SL unless you won't have the GCDs to maintain SL (e.g. mythic harjatan). </p>

    <p><strong><span style="font-size:30px">Recommended Talent Builds</span></strong></p>
    <p>7.2.5 added a lot of balance in the talent tree, allowing for a wide array of builds. M+ Builds are INCREDIBLY flexible, and will depend highly on affixes/dungeon/group composition. Sometimes you might need pure ST, others heavy aoe, others a healthy balance.</p>
    <p><strong>Low End content (Heroic dungeons, Low Level M+, Questing):</strong></p>  <x-talent talent="1102013" spec="Affliction"></x-talent> <p></p>
    <p><strong>General Purpose Single Target Raid Build:</strong></p> <x-talent talent="3101013" spec="Affliction"></x-talent>
    <p><strong>General Purpose Multi-Target Raid Build:</strong></p> <x-talent talent="2101012" spec="Affliction"></x-talent>
    <p><strong>Heavy DoT M+ Build:</strong></p> <x-talent talent="2101013" spec="Affliction"></x-talent> <p> This Build is very strong for dungeons/affixes that have lots of ST-3T. The focus is on maintaining your Agony/Corruption on every target and UAs on as many as possible. This works best with the legendary <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132457-power-cord-of-lethtendris" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Belt</span></a> and <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132381-stretens-sleepless-shackles" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Bracers</span></a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Heavy AoE M+ Build:</strong></p> <x-talent talent="3102013" spec="Affliction"></x-talent> <p> This Build is very strong for dungeons/affixes with lots of ST and AoE. Teeming weeks especially.</p>
