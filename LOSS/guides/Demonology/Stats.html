<p>Stat priorities are fairly straight forward and don't require much (or any) thought, the best way to look at getting stats is as follows: Any scenario:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Haste</li>
    <li>Intellect</li>
    <li>Critical Strike = Mastery</li>
    <li>Versatility</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Generally speaking something with Haste and either Mastery or Critical Strike will be best.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Intellect</h3></u>
  This is our primary stat, everything we do scales with it.
</p>
<p>
   <u><h3>Haste</h3></u>
   Haste rating increases the speed we cast, the rate our DoT ticks, the cast rate and attack speed of all your Demons; including your primary pet (Felguard), Wild Imps (summoned through Hand of Gul'dan), Dreadstalkers and Doomguard/Infernal. You will need 375 rating for 1% haste.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Mastery</h3></u>
  Provides a damage % modifier for your Demonic Empowerment. In Legion each spec has a different modifier for the amount of rating needed per percent gain. For Demonology a 1% damage increase is 222 Mastery Rating. If you want to see the formula it's here:
  <br><strong>((SpecModifier*Rating)/400)/100</strong>
  <br>So to find 1% for Demonology:
  <br><strong>400/1.8=222.22</strong>
  <br>Which makes the calculation:
  <br><strong>((1.8*222.22)/400)/100 = 0.0099999 (and since Blizzard rounds up values like that....) = 1%</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Critical Strike</h3></u>
  Increases your critical strike chance by 1% every 400 rating.
</p>
<p>
  <u><h3>Versatility</h3></u>
  Versatility is purposefully designed to be a flat DPS gain, it increases damage and healing and reduces damage taken by a flat %. To gain 1% versatility you need 475 rating.

<h2><u>Pawn & Simming your character</u></h2>

  For information on how to Sim your own character <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pW5mWY9nkfWoRCOHfoXqeeGb8s-jMoSVy-g8uveUv4c/preview" target="_blank">click here</a> and follow each step! Pawn is a useful tool you can use in game to help you decide on gear upgrades. It should not be used as gospel and when two pieces of gear are very similar in terms of "score" you should always sim them against each other. Follow the instructions <a href="https://notsthoughts.com/2016/12/03/how-to-sim-relics-easily/" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more about easily simming Relics that aren't equipped.
